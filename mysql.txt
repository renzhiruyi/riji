1:  Centos 7 comes with MariaDB instead of MySQL. MariaDb is a open source equivalent to MySQL and can be installed with 
:yum -y install mariadb-server mariadb.
 If you must have mysql you need to add the mysql-community repo
 sudo rpm -Uvh http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm 
 and then you can install MySQLl like you normally do



2:   yum install mysql-server mysql mysql-devel

3:  look up the grant of users:
    SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT('User: ''',user,'''@''',host,''';') AS query FROM mysql.user;
    show grants for 'SinaStore'@'%';
    desc mysql.user;
